# Library
These are the books I own.

# Installation

Install with this command:

  git clone git@github.com:twekberg/library.git

It assumes that sqlite is installed. The author used DB Browser for
SQLite to inspect the data.

# Use

Run:

  ./create.py
  
This will prompt for teh fields. Those fields that have defaults show
the default in ()s in the prompt. The author is remembered from the
previous author entry.

# Database

The name of the sqline dtatbase is library.db.
At some point I'll write a set of queries to display the data in various
ways using Python.
Until then, write your own using DB Browser for SQLite.
